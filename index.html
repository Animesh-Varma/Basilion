            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <span class="meta">Effective Date: December 07, 2025</span>

            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications (collectively, the "Apps") developed and published by <strong>Animesh Varma</strong>.</p>

            <p>I am committed to building software that respects user autonomy. My philosophy is simple: <strong>Your data belongs to you.</strong> The Apps are designed to minimize data collection and to avoid personal data processing whenever possible.</p>

            <h2>1. Scope and Overview</h2>
            <p>This policy covers both Apps that operate entirely offline and Apps that include optional online or AI-powered features. Where online services are used, data transmission is limited to what is necessary to provide the requested functionality.</p>

            <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
            <p>By default, the Apps are built to avoid gathering personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, precise location, or unique device identifiers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Developer Accounts:</strong> The Apps do not require you to create an account with the developer.</li>
                <li><strong>No Behavioral Profiling:</strong> The Apps do not collect data for advertising, cross-app tracking, or user profiling.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Offline Operation and Local Processing</h2>
            <p>For Apps that operate fully offline or focus on local utilities (for example, tools for encryption, file management, or note-taking):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Execution:</strong> Operations are performed on your device’s hardware (CPU/RAM).</li>
                <li><strong>Ephemeral Memory:</strong> Sensitive data (such as passwords, keys, or plaintext content) is held in memory only for as long as needed for the current operation and is released when the operation completes or the App is closed.</li>
                <li><strong>Intentional Persistence Only:</strong> Input data is written to storage only when you explicitly perform actions such as “Save” or “Export”.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Online and AI-Powered Features</h2>
            <p>Some Apps may provide optional online or AI-assisted functionality (for example, generating content, suggestions, or responses):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> When you use these features, the text or content you provide may be transmitted over the internet to a third-party service (such as a cloud-based AI provider) solely to generate the requested result.</li>
                <li><strong>No Developer Storage:</strong> The developer does not use this transmitted data to build profiles, does not sell it, and does not intentionally store it on developer-controlled servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Policies:</strong> Any data sent to a third-party service is processed under that provider’s own terms and privacy policy, which may include temporary retention for security or service improvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Android Permissions</h2>
            <p>The Apps request only the minimum permissions required for their core functionality. For <strong>Coeus</strong> specifically, the following permissions are critical:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Near Field Communication (NFC):</strong> Used exclusively to interact with physical NFC tags, smart cards, and similar hardware. This permission allows the App to send and receive low-level commands (APDU) to the tag.</li>
                <li><strong>Vibration:</strong> Used to provide haptic feedback when a tag is successfully detected or when an operation completes.</li>
                <li><strong>Clipboard Access:</strong> To allow you to paste content into the App or copy results out of it. Clipboard contents are not continuously monitored.</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To inform you when a long-running local task or process has completed.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage / Files &amp; Media:</strong> To read or write files that you explicitly select, such as when encrypting, decrypting, loading, or saving content.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet:</strong> For Apps that provide online or AI-powered features, internet access is used solely to communicate with the necessary external service. (Currently only required by <strong>LOTL</strong> for communication with the Gemini API)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can review and manage App permissions at any time in your device settings.</p>

            <h2>6. NFC Data and Sensitive Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Coeus</strong> is capable of reading raw data from various NFC technologies, which may include sensitive information (such as unique identifiers, payment card metadata, or access control keys).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All communication with NFC tags happens directly between your device's NFC controller and the tag. The data read from the tag is processed entirely within your device's memory (RAM).</li>
                <li><strong>No Transmission:</strong> The App <strong>does not</strong> automatically transmit scanned tag data, UIDs, or keys to any external server or cloud service.</li>
                <li><strong>Keys and Secrets:</strong> Any cryptographic keys (AES, DES, etc.) you enter or generate within the App are stored in your device's secure storage (Keystore) and are never shared with the developer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The Apps do not integrate third-party advertising networks or data broker SDKs. Where third-party services are used (for example, AI or platform services), they are used only to deliver functionality requested by you, not for advertising or user tracking.</p>

            <h2>8. User Rights and Control</h2>
            <p>Because the Apps are designed to avoid storing personal data on developer-controlled servers, there is typically no centralized account data for the developer to access, modify, or delete on your behalf. Any content you create or store locally on your device can usually be managed or removed using in-App options or your device’s file management tools.</p>

            <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Apps are not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). The developer does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

            <h2>10. Security</h2>
            <p>Reasonable technical and organizational measures are used to help protect data processed by the Apps, including limiting data collection, preferring local processing, and avoiding unnecessary retention. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and you are encouraged to protect your device with appropriate security measures.</p>

            <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in legal requirements, platform policies, or App functionality. Any changes will be posted with an updated “Effective Date”, and continued use of the Apps after such changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

            <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India, specifically the laws of the State of Madhya Pradesh.</p>

            <h2>13. Contact</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the Apps, please contact:</p>
